The phone only checked for the second signature. The first signature was for protection and authentication while the app was being developed and approved. I think the \"signer\" here is like the Qualcomm signature. It's the entity that approves running on the device. It's not the vendor of the component. Is that right?\r\n\r\nIt is right.  However, if the original developer's signature was not removed (and could also be measured during boot), it could, in principle, be added to the `signers` array alongside Qualcomm's.\r\n \r\n> (Also, my knowledge of UEFI is limited...)\r\n\r\nWhoever claims complete knowledge of UEFI is a liar :-)\r\n",

It seems odd that the draft leaves open the possibility of no profile to be present (which is fine) but does not describe how to interpret the fields in that case. Rejection seems fine, i.e., it is an error for a sender to prepare an EAT that features these fields with no profile and receivers should reject EATs created that way.\n",
