The phone only checked for the second signature. The first signature was for protection and authentication while the app was being developed and approved. I think the \"signer\" here is like the Qualcomm signature. It's the entity that approves running on the device. It's not the vendor of the component. Is that right?\r\n\r\nIt is right.  However, if the original developer's signature was not removed (and could also be measured during boot), it could, in principle, be added to the `signers` array alongside Qualcomm's.\r\n \r\n> (Also, my knowledge of UEFI is limited...)\r\n\r\nWhoever claims complete knowledge of UEFI is a liar :-)\r\n",
